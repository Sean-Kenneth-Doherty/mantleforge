## Project Overview

### Name
**MantleForge** - AI Smart Contract Builder

### Tagline
Generate smart contracts from natural language, deploy to Mantle in seconds.

### Category
Infrastructure & Tooling

---

## Problem & Solution

### Problem
Creating smart contracts requires specialized Solidity knowledge, creating barriers for:
- Non-technical founders launching tokens
- Developers new to Web3
- Teams needing rapid prototyping

### Solution
MantleForge uses AI to translate natural language into production-ready Solidity contracts deployable to Mantle Network.

**Example:**
Input: "Create an ERC-20 token called MantleGold with 1 million supply"
Output: Complete, deployable ERC-20 contract

---

## Features

### Implemented
- ✅ Natural language → Solidity generation
- ✅ 6 contract templates (ERC-20, NFT, Timelock, Voting, MultiSig, Staking)
- ✅ Web3 wallet integration (MetaMask)
- ✅ Automatic Mantle network switching
- ✅ One-click Remix deployment
- ✅ Beautiful, responsive UI

### Roadmap
- 🔜 Direct on-chain deployment
- 🔜 Contract verification
- 🔜 AI-powered security audit
- 🔜 Contract marketplace

---

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript + TailwindCSS
- AI: Pattern matching + templates (Claude API planned)
- Blockchain: ethers.js + Mantle RPC
- Hosting: GitHub Pages

---

## Why Mantle?

1. **10x cheaper gas** - Deploy for pennies
2. **EVM equivalent** - All Solidity works natively
3. **Fast finality** - Quick deployments
4. **Growing ecosystem** - Perfect for new developers
